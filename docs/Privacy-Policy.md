# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 26/09/2025

### 1. Introduction

This application is designed to provide secure, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between users. We take your privacy seriously. This document explains what information we collect, what we do with it, and how we protect your data.

### 2. Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or process any of the following on our servers:

- Your messages, files, or calls
- Your contacts or address book
- Your IP address or location
- Any personal identifiers
- All communication happens directly between usersâ€™ devices using peer-to-peer connections.

### 3. Local Data

Some data may be stored locally on your device after encryption, such as:

- Your settings and preferences
- Encryption keys (for secure communication)
- Messages

This information never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it.

### 4. Third-Party Services

The app does not use analytics, tracking services, or advertising networks. If you use features that rely on third-party services (e.g., push notifications), their privacy policies will apply.

### 5. Security

Messages and calls are encrypted end-to-end. Only the intended recipient(s) can decrypt and access the content. We cannot access or recover your conversations.

### 6. Your Responsibilities

- Since communication is peer-to-peer, you are responsible for:
- Ensuring you only connect with trusted contacts
- Keeping your device and encryption keys secure

### 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.
