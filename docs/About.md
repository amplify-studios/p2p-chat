## Our Vision

We want this application to stand as a true alternative to traditional chat platforms, offering the same seamless, real-time communication experience without compromising user freedom or privacy. Every user should have complete control over their data: the ability to host their own servers, manage their own identity, and communicate securely without relying on centralized intermediaries. Our goal is to make peer-to-peer communication not just private, but effortless â€” combining decentralization, encryption, and autonomy with the polish and usability people expect from modern messaging apps.

## Our Manifesto

- We believe in **privacy** as a right.
- We believe in **open collaboration** and **transparency**.  
- We believe in a world where communication is private, direct, and **free from centralized control**.
